# Dynamic-Price-Optimization-Recommendation-Engine

## Problem Statement
Retail businesses struggle to price products optimally due to changing demand,
inventory pressure, and competitor pricing. Manual pricing often leads to
overstocking or revenue loss.

## Objective
Build a data-driven pricing recommendation system that suggests optimal price
adjustments for low-performing products using sales velocity, inventory levels,
and competitor prices.

## Data Sources
- Products
- Store Sales Line Items
- Store Inventory Snapshot
- Competitor Prices (Simulated)

## Approach
1. Ingest and clean datasets
2. Engineer demand and inventory features
3. Analyze price competitiveness
4. Apply rule-based pricing heuristics
5. Recommend price adjustments
6. Visualize insights via dashboard

## Output
- Recommended price
- Markdown percentage
- Pricing action (Keep / Discount / Aggressive Discount)

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Streamlit
- Git & GitHub
